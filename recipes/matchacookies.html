        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, matcha powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes) using an electric mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract until combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>If using, gently fold in the white chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie as they will spread while baking.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look slightly underbaked but will continue to cook on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
